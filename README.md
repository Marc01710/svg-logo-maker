  ## Description

  This project is a command-line application that generates a logo in SVG format based on what the user inputs. The user gets prompted to input text, color selection and shape to generate an svg. My motivation to make this application is to provide a simple logo generator for developers that need a quick logo made for their projects.  The svg lgo maker solves the problem oof creating a custom logo quickly and efficiently.  Through the development of this project I gained experience in using Node.js and working with command line prompts and handling user input.
